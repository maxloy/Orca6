Overview
****************************************

We have all seen game with beutiful rolling backgrounds, now you can have them too!

Making a racing game? Then no problem with Mega-Shapes. Draw a path for the road, draw a cross section and then loft a road. Want more detail? Then Loft a barrier and it will automatically conform to the road surface. Slide the barriers in or out, scale them, twist them, you imagination is the only limitation.

Want more? Then use the powerful rail clone feature to repeat and position sets of objects along your road, fences, powerlines, trees whatever you like.

Still not enough? For those that want even more Mega-Shapes gives you a scatter system that will take any objects you choose and scatter them along your road and have them auotmatically conform to the existing meshes surface.

With Mega-Shapes you can create beutiful levels quickly and easily.


MegaShapes is a system that builds meshed from splines, this can be anything from simple lines, ribbons using shapes as the paths to complex lofts of multiple spline cross sections along a spline path. Combined with this is an advanced layer system for adding deltails to the lofts, with layers that allow cloning of objects, as well as scattering objects over a loft to a full rule based system for building detailed meshes along a path or mapped to a loft surface.

All aspects of the system can be edited in realtime with layers conforming automatically to any changes in the base shapes or surfaces allowing for very easy editing and updating.

MegaShapes current features:
Full spline bezier based spline system.
Turn shapes into meshes with uv mapping and extrusion options
Controllers for moving objects along paths
3ds max exporter to get paths and animated paths easily into the system (soon to be extended to other editors as well as support for vector based files)
Simple loft system to extrude any shape along another to build roads, tubes, surfaces etc
Advanced loft system to allow any number of cross sections to be used to build a loft surface
Loft layers to add further detail to surfaces, layers currently included (more to come):
	Clone - Take any mesh and duplicate it along a surface with options for start and end meshes
	Clone Spline - Clone a mesh along a shape again with start end mesh options
	Scatter - randomly scatter meshes onto a loft surface
	Scatter Spline - randomly scatter meshes along a spline
	Clone Rules - Adanced rule based mesh builder, current rules are:
		Start	- Object to be used at the start
		End		- Object to be used at the end
		Filler	- Main filler object
		Regular	- Object to appear every Nth object
		Placed	- Object to appear at specific location
		
		You can have any number of rules and where more than one of the same type is found a weighting value is used to choose which to use.
	Clone Spline - Like above but along a spline.

Features to come in updates:
Fast Rope and chain system
Scatter objects inside splines
Animated breaking Wave simulator
Move loft layers and enhancements to the current system
Move rules for the rule based layers
